## TO DO

- Login page
  - Research how to do this. May make / page an unprotected path and call the standard page "jobs". Then single job is "I'd:..." (Result is "jobs/id:..." Still need to redirect all pages to /.

- Quill / Markdown
  - Can I simplify to normal, H1, H2 instead of px drop-down?
  - Can I enforce text being pasted to be formatted in my font or lock to only one don't can be used? 
  - Can I enforce the default size font?
  - Why do I have a bug where the first thing I select in text shrinks?

- Job Table
  - explore doing a salary and distance view of the table
  - salary would have your current salary outside of the table, then each job would show the range and then how much above or below % increase with color on the %.
  - opens idea of a budget calculator to identify min salary based on adding. 

- could there be a general notes or to do section on a dashboard or as a side panel by default on the jobs screen? would be helpful to keep track of little things or maybe tips collected.
